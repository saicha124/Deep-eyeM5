## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- API keys for AI providers (at least one):
  - OpenAI API Key
  - Anthropic (Claude) API Key
  - Grok API Key
  - OLLAMA (local installation)

## 🔧 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zakirkun/deep-eye.git
cd deep-eye
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure AI providers:
```bash
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your API keys
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Scan with target from CLI
python deep_eye.py -u https://example.com

# Scan with configuration file
python deep_eye.py -c myconfig.yaml

# Verbose mode
python deep_eye.py -u https://example.com -v
```

### Configuration-Driven Scanning
All scan options are configured in `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
scanner:
  target_url: "https://example.com"  # Default target
  ai_provider: "openai"               # AI provider
  default_depth: 2                    # Crawl depth
  default_threads: 5                  # Thread count
  enable_recon: true                  # Enable reconnaissance
  full_scan: false                    # Full/quick scan mode
  proxy: ""                           # Proxy settings
  custom_headers: {}                  # Custom headers

reporting:
  enabled: true                       # Auto-generate reports
  output_directory: "reports"         # Report directory
  default_format: "html"              # Report format
```

Then run:
```bash
python deep_eye.py
```

### Command Line Options (Minimal)
```
-u, --url              Target URL (overrides config)
-c, --config           Configuration file path (default: config/config.yaml)
-v, --verbose          Enable verbose output
--version              Show version and exit
--no-banner            Disable banner display
```

**Note:** All scanning options (depth, threads, AI provider, scan mode, proxy, etc.) are now configured in `config.yaml` for better management and repeatability.

## 🌍 Multi-Language Report Support

Deep Eye now supports generating reports in **three languages**:

- **English** (`en`) - Default
- **Français** (French) (`fr`) 
- **العربية** (Arabic) (`ar`)

To choose your report language, edit `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
reporting:
  language: "en"  # Options: en (English), fr (Français), ar (العربية)
```

All report elements are translated, including titles, sections, vulnerability details, and remediation guidance. See [docs/MULTI_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md](docs/MULTI_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation.

## � Troubleshooting

### PDF Report Generation

**Issue**: PDF generation errors on Windows (WeasyPrint library issues)

**Solution**: The tool now uses ReportLab (Windows-friendly) for PDF generation by default. If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure ReportLab is installed:
```bash
pip install reportlab>=4.0.0
```

2. If PDF generation fails, the tool will automatically fall back to HTML format.

3. For advanced HTML-to-PDF conversion (optional), you can install additional tools, but it's not required.

### Common Issues

**AI Provider Connection Errors**
- Verify your API keys in `config/config.yaml`
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure API key has sufficient credits

**Scanning Errors**
- Verify target URL is accessible
- Check if target has rate limiting or WAF
- Try reducing thread count with `-t` option

**IMPORTANT**: Deep Eye is designed for authorized security testing only.

- Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
