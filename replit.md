## Setup & Configuration

### Current Configuration (Ready to Use)
The tool is configured and ready to scan without AI:
- **AI Providers**: Disabled (uses default payloads)
- **Payload Generation**: Using built-in default payloads
- **ML Detection**: Disabled (requires training data)
- **All Core Scanners**: Enabled (SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, etc.)

### To Enable AI Features (Optional)
1. Edit `config/config.yaml`
2. Add API keys for OpenAI, Claude, Grok, or OLLAMA
3. Enable the provider: `enabled: true`
4. Enable AI payloads: `payload_generation.use_ai: true`

### Configuration File
Location: `config/config.yaml`
- Scanner settings (depth, threads, timeouts)
- Enabled vulnerability checks
- Report formats and preferences
- Network settings (proxy, headers, cookies)

## Usage
```bash
# Basic scan
python deep_eye.py -u https://example.com

# Scan with verbose output
python deep_eye.py -u https://example.com -v

# Generate multilingual reports (English, French, Arabic)
python deep_eye.py -u https://example.com --multilingual

# Use custom config file
python deep_eye.py -c custom_config.yaml

# Show version
python deep_eye.py --version
```
